# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Recognition-System-Using-Deep-Learning
Developed a real-time sign language recognition system using CNN, RNN, and LSTM to translate gestures into text/speech, enabling communication between deaf and hearing individuals. Integrated OpenCV and MediaPipe for gesture tracking and deep learning for accurate translation.
